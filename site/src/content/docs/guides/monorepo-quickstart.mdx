Starting with the [simple quickstart](/docs/guides/quickstart) is a good first step even when targeting a monorepo. The next thing you'd want to do is potentially add more release groups to define what the release lines are for the various projects in your monorepo.

For instance if you are building a monorepo that contains:

- Server/API layer that is the core of the project
- A dashboard web app that talks to the API
- A TypeScript CLI and SDK that your users can install and use

You might set up your bumper configuration like so:

```sh
bumper init
bumper create api dashboard npm-packages
```

Then you would potentially customize the commands that would best suite your workflow. For example, you might use the bumper's built-in npm integrations for the `dashboard` and a script that can version the `npm-packages` together. Your final configuration might look something like this:

```toml title=".bumper/bumper.toml" {"Store server version in a plain file":7} {8,9} {"Use npm versioning for dashboard":17} {18,19} {"Version CLI/SDK together":27} {28,29}

  base_branch = "origin/main"
  changelog_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "amendlog:default"]
  cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]

  current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:file", "--path", "server/VERSION"]
  next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:file", "--path", "server/VERSION"]

  cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]

  current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:npm", "--package", "dashboard/package.json"]
  next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:npm", "--package", "dashboard/package.json"]

[[groups]]
  name = "npm-packages"
  display_name = "npm-packages"
  base_branch = "origin/main"
  changelog_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "amendlog:default"]
  cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]

  current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:npm", "--package", "sdk/package.json"]
  next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:default", "--package", "sdk/package.json", "--package", "cli/package.json"]
```

You can read more about configuring Bumper in the [configuration docs](/docs/configuration).
