Bumper integrates seamlessly into your existing development workflow and CI/CD process.

Here's how to set it up in a repository with a single package:

1. Initialize your project with `bumper init`.
2. Create a release group with `bumper create <name>`.
3. [Integrate it into your CI/CD process.](/ci-cd)

That's it for the setup phase! Now we move to the bump phase. Any time you make an interesting change that needs to be released:

4. Create a bump with `bumper bump` and include it with a pull request (you can also commit it directly if you practice trunk-based development).

Time goes on and you accumulate bumps...

When you're ready to cut a release:

5. Run `bumper commit` which updates the release group version and the changelog.
6. Merge any changes into your default git branch.
7. Rinse and repeat!
