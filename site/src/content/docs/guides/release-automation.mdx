Automated publishing should be possible if your CI/CD system can trigger pipelines based on specific file changes.

As a worked example, let's say we have a GitHub repository that hosts an NPM package and uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

We'll start it off by creating a release group:

```
bumper init
bumper create my-package
```

Our bumper config will look something like this:

```toml title=".bumper/config.toml"
[[groups]]
name = "my-package"
display_name = "my-package"
base_branch = "origin/main"
changelog_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "amendlog:default"]
cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]
current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:default"]
next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:default"]
```

The next thing we'll do is change the versioning strategy to better suite npm projects:

```diff lang="toml" title=".bumper/config.toml"
[[groups]]
name = "my-package"
display_name = "my-package"
base_branch = "origin/main"
changelog_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "amendlog:default"]
cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]
-current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:default"]
-next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:default"]
+current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:npm", "--package", "package.json"]
+next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:npm", "--package", "package.json"]
```

Now, whenever you run `bumper commit` it will update a package.json with the new version of `my-package`. We'll drive CI/CD off of that.

<Aside>

We'll assume you're using [NPM trusted publishing][npm-tp] which doesn't require storing an NPM token as a GitHub actions secret. Highly recommended if you're publishing from GitHub Actions.

Here's what a sample GitHub Actions workflow could look like to achieve this:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths: [package.json]

concurrency: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

jobs:
  npm-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # To push tags
      id-token: write # To publish using NPM trusted publishing

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@ff7abcd0c3c05ccf6adc123a8cd1fd4fb30fb493 # v5.0.0

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Set up Mise
        uses: jdx/mise-action@be3be2260bc02bc3fbf94c5e2fed8b7964baf074 # v3.4.0
        with:
          mise_toml: |
            [tools]
            node = "24"
            bumper = "latest"

      - name: Get latest version
        id: bumper
        run: |
          latest_version=$(mise bumper latest --group my-package)
          echo "latest_version=$latest_version" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          if npm view "my-package@$latest_version" version &>/dev/null; then
            echo "Version $latest_version already exists on NPM. Skipping publish."
            echo "should_publish=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "should_publish=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Publish
        if: steps.bumper.outputs.should_publish == 'true'
        run: |
          npm publish --provenance

          tag="v${{ steps.bumper.outputs.latest_version }}"
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git tag "$tag"
          git push origin "$tag"
```
