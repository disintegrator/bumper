title: Semantic versioning

Bumper relies on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to manage version
numbers for your projects. You might have seen semantic versioning in so many
places when developing software. When used effectively, it helps communicate
how a project changes over time and at a glance can tell you if the next version
contains breaking changes, new features, or just bug fixes.
