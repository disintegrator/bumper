A release group is the logical component that you will be versioning and releasing. In simple repositories, you will have a single release group that represents the project you are working on. In more complex monorepos, you may have several release groups that track one or more packages.

## Worked example

Let's consider a monorepo that contains a server, a dashboard and a couple of npm packages:

```js title="bumper.config.js"
.bumper/
  config.toml
  versions.toml
dashboard/
  ...
packages/
  cli/
    package.json  # "name": "@myorg/cli"
    ...
  sdk/
    package.json  # "name": "@myorg/sdk"
    ...
server/
  ...
```

And the following requirements:

- dashboard is versioned and released independently
- server is versioned and released independently
- packages/cli and packages/sdk are versioned and released together as a single unit

You could solve this by creating three release groups:

```
bumper create dashboard server tools
```

Any time you make a change to either `packages/cli` or `packages/sdk`, you would create a bump that targets the `tools` release group:

```
bumper bump --group tools
```

<Aside>

You can also omit the `--group` flag and pick it in the wizard when you run `bumper bump`.

When it comes to publish these packages, you would run:

```sh
npm version -w @myorg/cli -w @myorg/sdk $(bumper current --group tools)
npm publish -w @myorg/cli -w @myorg/sdk
```
