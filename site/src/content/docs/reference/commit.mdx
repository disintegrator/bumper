description: Commits are how you squash pending bumps and kick off the release process
---

When you're ready to cut a release of a project, you'll run `bumper commit` to process all of the pending bumps that have been added since the last release.

## Worked example

Let's imagine on your main branch you have a monorepo with two release groups:

- `dashboard` which is currently at version 3.14.1
- `api` which is currently at version 1.7.4

Over time, three pull requests have been merged that added the following bump files:

```
.bumper/
  bump-gentle-camels-cross-lazily.md
  bump-curious-dolphins-dance-daily.md
  bump-happy-elephants-eat-enthusiastically.md
  versions.toml
api/
dashboard/
CHANGELOG.md
```

```md title=".bumper/bump-gentle-camels-cross-lazily.md"
---
dashboard: minor
---

Added an account settings page where users can update their profile information.
```

```md title=".bumper/bump-curious-dolphins-dance-daily.md"
---
api: patch
dashboard: patch
---

Fixed a bug where the API would return a 500 error when no authentication token was provided.
```

```md title=".bumper/bump-happy-elephants-eat-enthusiastically.md"
---
dashboard: patch
---

Updated the dashboard to include a graph of share price over time.
```

When you run `bumper commit`, it will determine the following:

- `dashboard` has three bumps: one "minor" and two "patch" -> The highest level bump is "minor" -> The new version will be 3.15.0.
- `api` has one bump: a "patch" -> The new version will be 1.7.5.

If you're using the out of the box defaults, it will:

- Update `.bumper/versions.toml` to reflect these new versions.

  ```toml title=".bumper/versions.toml"
  [versions]
  dashboard = "3.15.0"
  api = "1.7.5"
  ```

- Insert the following to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`:

  ```md title="CHANGELOG.md"
