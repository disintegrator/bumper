## With `curl`

```

## With `go`

```sh

```

## With `mise`

<Code code={`mise use github:disintegrator/bumper@${__VERSION__}`} lang="sh" />

## APK, Debian and RPM packages

You can find pre-built packages for various Linux distributions on the [Releases](https://github.com/disintegrator/bumper/releases) page. These can all be verified using cosign by following the steps in the next section.

## Manually and verify with cosign

All release artifacts are signed using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) with keyless signing. You can verify the authenticity of the downloaded binaries by checking the signature against the checksums file.

First, download the checksums file and its signature:

<Code
  code={`
VERSION=${__VERSION__}
BASE_URL="https://github.com/disintegrator/bumper/releases/download/v$VERSION"
curl -fsSLO "$BASE_URL/checksums.txt"
curl -fsSLO "$BASE_URL/checksums.txt.pem"
curl -fsSLO "$BASE_URL/checksums.txt.keyless.sig"
curl -fsSLO "$BASE_URL/bumper_$VERSION_darwin_arm64.tar.gz"
`.trim()}
  lang="sh"
/>

Verify the checksums file with cosign:

```sh
cosign verify-blob checksums.txt \
  --certificate checksums.txt.pem \
  --signature checksums.txt.keyless.sig \
  --certificate-identity 'https://github.com/disintegrator/bumper/.github/workflows/release.yaml@refs/heads/main' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
```

Verify your downloaded artifact or installed binary matches the checksum:

```sh
sha256sum --check checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

Finally, extract the binary and move it to your PATH:

<Code
  code={`
tar -xzf bumper_${__VERSION__}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
mv bumper /usr/local/bin/bumper
`.trim()}
  lang="sh"
/>
