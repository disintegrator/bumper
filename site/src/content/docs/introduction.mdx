Providing a changelog with your apps and libraries is essential of the "release process" and helps keep your users informed about the latest features and fixes you're shipping with each release.

Planning releases and maintaining changelogs in lockstep can be a tedious process and in the most basic form involves manually updating version numbers and manually summarizing recent commits into a changelog file.

This is where Bumper comes in...

## How it works

Bumper integrates seamlessly into your existing development workflow and CI/CD process. It works like this:

1. You initialize your project with `bumper init`.
2. You create a release group with `bumper create <name>`.
3. Any time you make an interesting change that needs to be released, you create a bump with `bumper bump` and include with the same commit or as part of a pull request.
4. When you're ready to release, you run `bumper commit` which update the release group version and the changelog.
5. Depending on what tooling you use to release your project (such as `npm publish`, `goreleaser release`, etc.), you can incorporate the release group version with `bumper latest --group <name>` and if you need the release notes for a version you use `bumper cat --group <name> <version>`.
6. Rinse and repeat!

It doesn't end there. Bumper can help you manage releases and changelogs for one package or a monorepo with many packages.
