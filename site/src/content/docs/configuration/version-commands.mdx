There are two versioning commands that Bumper relies as part of the release process and to power command like `bumper latest` and `bumper commit`. Each release group must configure these:

```toml {"Version commands":6} {7,8}
[[groups]]
name = "my-package"
display_name = "my-package"
changelog_cmd = ["..."]
cat_cmd = ["..."]

current_cmd = ["..."]
next_cmd = ["..."]
```

## `current_cmd`

This command is used to read the current version of a release group. It is called with the following environment variables set:

- `BUMPER_GROUP`: The release group whose version is being requested

It must only output the version string to standard output (`STDOUT`). For example, if your `current_cmd` is `["./get-current-version"]` and the user runs `bumper latest --group my-package`, the command will be called like this:

```bash
BUMPER_GROUP="my-package" ./get-current-version
```

And it would be expected to output a version like so:

```
1.2.3
```

Direct any logging or error reporting to standard error (`STDERR`) so that Bumper can correctly parse the version from stdout.

## `next_cmd`

This command is used to update the version of a release group. It is called with the following environment variables set:

- `BUMPER_GROUP`: The release group whose version is being updated
- `BUMPER_GROUP_NEXT_VERSION`: The next version for the group to update to

If your `next_cmd` is `["./set-next-version"]` and the user runs `bumper commit`, the command will be called _once per release group_ like this:

```bash
BUMPER_GROUP="my-package" BUMPER_GROUP_NEXT_VERSION="1.2.4" ./set-next-version
```

Bumper does not expect any output from this command, but it's a good idea to still direct any logging or error reporting to `STDERR`.
