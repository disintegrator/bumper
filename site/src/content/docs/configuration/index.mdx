A (subjectively) nice thing about Bumper is that instead of providing endless configuration options and strong opinions baked into them, it chooses to go with a more unix philosophy of delegating various tasks to smaller programs or scripts.

At its core, bumper needs to do 4 things:

- Read the current version of a release group
- Update the version of a release group
- Edit a changelog
- Read the release notes of a release group at given version

You can see these reflected in the configuration file. Here are the default options that are written out when you run `bumper create`:

```toml title:".bumper/config.toml"
[[groups]]
name = "bumper"
display_name = "Bumper"
changelog_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "amendlog:default"]
cat_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "cat:default"]
current_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "current:default"]
next_cmd = ["bumper", "builtins", "next:default"]
```

A quick explanation of each field:

- `name`: the release group name and what is referenced when running bumper commands.
- `display_name`: a human friendly name for the release group that is used in changelogs.
- `changelog_cmd`: the command that bumper will run to update the changelog when a new version is released.
- `cat_cmd`: the command that bumper will run to read the release notes for a given version.
- `current_cmd`: the command that bumper will run to read the current version of the release group.
- `next_cmd`: the command that bumper will run to update the version of the release group.
